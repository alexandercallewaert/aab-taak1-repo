## R Markdown - Introduction

This document can be used to add notes to codes and write down our insights on the output we get.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)     ## install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readr)
```

```{r}
## read train data csv. Note the readr:: prefix identifies which package it's in
train <- readr::read_csv2("data/train.csv")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
